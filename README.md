Assignment 05

The layout for the index page is in a z-pattern layout. The lion, giraffe and button that has the person take a survery should be at the bottom in three columns, with the signup button being in the last column since according the the z-pattern it will have the most focus. The other pages for the lion and giraffe sites are in an f-pattern layout.

The mood of the website should be safari, outside theme since the two animals that were chosen are btoh from the safari.

The main focus should be the survey and secondly should be the sign in. The survey should be in bigger font and size versus the sign in.

Note these are all suggestions. I started the html files for the login system, pelase feel free to edit/change/delete them.
