Midterm 1

The topic chosen was the country Mexico, the website provides a small amount of information regarding the country.
The main purpose of the website it to provide some information regarding the history and culture of Mexico. The first thing that catches the attention is the title in big letters a the top og the website, secondly the navigation, which is in the order of th eome page then the histor and then the culture. Likewise on the home page (reading left to right), at the bottom of the page the first choice is hisotry and then culture.

Z-Pattern: The home page has a z-pattern layout. If this were an actual site the first thing that would want to be looked at is the logo and what the website is about then to give the option of signing up for the newsletter (note this is smaller font than the title because the main focus is the information). Next a quick glimpse of pictures and finally in the last two quadrants the abiitiy to click for more information regarding the topic.
F-Pattern: The history and culture sites are in an F-pattern layout. The furthest right column has the main topics of each set of paragraphs and the user is able to decide which subtopic they would want to read about.
C: There is contrast with the banner and content of the site itself i.e. the banner has a blue ish background color while the content is in a white background.
R: The layout for each subtopic/sub information of the main topics (history and culture) have the same layout. This is done because they belong to the same general topic (hisotry of culture), but are speerated because they are different subtopics. All subtopics have the same font bold and larger font, all paragraphs of information that belong to each subtpoic is in regular sized font. Also all figurecaptions are in the same font type i.e. italicized.
A: The culture and hisotr sites have an F-layout that allows the user to see the subtopics on the farthest right and in the middle in the information while on the right a picture.
P: The paragrahs that belong to the subtopics are next to the subtopic heading <h2> likewise for the picture that belongs with the infromaiton is next tot he paragraphs.
The two fonts used are:
font-family: 'Lateef', cursive; for the main heading <h1>
font-family: 'Scheherazade', serif; for the rest of the text
these fonts were chosen to portray the joy in the mexican culture and the importance of the history 
To organize the website I used a dispaly flex for most of the content and a display grid for the the slider. I used grid because I was able to manipulate it to the center better. I used flex so that the sizing of the content would increase/decrease dpending on the browser size.
